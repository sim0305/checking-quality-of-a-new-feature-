Assuming an SQL database, you might use queries like:
Query 1: Verify User Insights Data
sql
SELECT * FROM UserInsights
WHERE UserID = 'testUserID';
It Ensures that the insights displayed correspond to the correct user data.

Query 2: Check Data Consistency Across Tables
sql
SELECT ui.InsightID, ui.MetricValue, th.TransactionAmount
FROM UserInsights ui
JOIN TradingHistory th ON ui.UserID = th.UserID
WHERE ui.UserID = 'testUserID';

It Validates that insights are accurately generated based on the user’s trading history.

Why These Queries Are Important:
•	Data Accuracy: Confirm that data displayed to users is correct and consistent with what's stored in the database.
•	Integrity Checks: Identify discrepancies to avoid potential financial misrepresentations.
